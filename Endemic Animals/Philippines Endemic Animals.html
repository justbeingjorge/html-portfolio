    <h1>Endemic Animals of the Philippines</h1>
    <p>The Philippines is home to a diverse range of endemic animals, meaning they are not found anywhere else in the world. Here are some notable examples:</p>

        <p>Known as the “world’s smallest monkey” because of its similarity in appearance to that primate, 
            tarsiers, along with lemurs, tree shrews, and lorises, actually are members of a more primitive suborder 
            of Prosimii or prosimian. They are amongst the oldest land species that have existed continuously in the Philippines, 
            dating from the early Eocene period, 45 million years ago.</p>

            <li><h2>Philippine Monkey Eating Eagle</h2></li>

         </a>
        <p>The Philippine Eagle is one of the largest and most powerful birds of prey in the world. 
            It is known for its striking appearance, with a distinctive crest of feathers on its head and a strong, hooked beak. 
            The Philippine Eagle is also critically endangered, with only a few hundred individuals remaining in the wild.</p>

            <li><h2>Tamaraw</h2></li>
        </a>
            <img src = "Animal Picture/Tamaraw.png" alt="Tamaraw" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>The Tamaraw is a small, endangered buffalo species found only on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. 
            It is known for its distinctive V-shaped horns and is considered a national symbol of the Philippines. 
            The Tamaraw is critically endangered, with only a few hundred individuals remaining in the wild.</p>

        <li><h2>Visayan Wart pig</h2></li>
        </a>
            <img src = "Animal Picture/Visayan Wart Pig.png" alt="Visayan Wart Pig" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>The Visayan warty pig is endangered primarily due to habitat loss caused by human activities like commercial 
                logging and agriculture, as well as hunting and poaching for meat. Additionally, interbreeding with domestic
                 pigs can lead to genetic dilution, further endangering the species. </p>
